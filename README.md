# BookSeattle - front-end
Create a website that allows for booking rooms that are available for reservation. By selecting the desired dates and the number of guests, a list of rooms and their features will populate, based on if they are available during those dates. I will be creating a full-stack responsive web app to let users view, explore and book the room they want. Will have the ability to search, make reservations and receive payments.

## Features

* Booking system to stay in Seattle
* Themed rooms for different types of people
* Calendar system for booking a room
* Eventuallly extend it to be breakfast and bed chain all over the world

### Draft Technology Choices
- Backend - Ruby on Rails
- Webpack
- Panel (https://github.com/mixpanel/panel)
- AWS

### Special thanks to
Ada Developers Academy that has let me get my first steps into the IT field in Seattle. My awesome instructors Dan, Jamie and Crystal. Also, Charles, Chris, Kari, Korica, Susan, Brooks, Sarah, Elsa, Jeff, Rowan and David. My big heart goes to all my fellow Adies. I've learned so much from each one of you and we will grow more and we will rule the IT world!!
Also, I would like to thank [Jack](https://github.com/eternal-turtles) who has guided me through the process of how to make a full-stack website on Panel. This has been a good starting point as my capstone project, but I will definitely keep working on it.
